<h1 align="center">Your First Contribution to a Repo!</h1>

This is probably your first project where you will make your contribution to this project and get a check on how well you understood git and github and how to contribute to open source projects with the help of it.

SO LET'S GOO!!

# Steps to Contribute to this project
1. Create a file following this naming convention - 

``` your_name_fibonacii_series.ext ```

You can code the problem in any programming language of your choice.

2. Create a branch named ```name:first-pr```.

3. Create a PR for it.

4. Wait for me to merge your PR.

5. It's done your code is now merged with the main codebase of the project.

##  If you finish this early , I still have a challenge for you ðŸ˜®

Try solving the problem using recursion and then using dyammic programming and again create a new branch and name it ```name:second-pr``` and create a PR for it again.

# All the Best!
